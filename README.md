# n8n Development

This project is for building n8n components.  There may be existing components out there, but this is more of a learning exercise for me to get familiar with the process.

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute, please fork and submit a PR.  I am open to suggestions for improvements as well.

### Branch Protection & PR Requirements

This repository uses branch protection rules to ensure code quality:
- All changes must be made through pull requests from feature branches
- Direct commits to `main` are not allowed
- All PRs require approval from @thetallbloke before merging
- Please create a feature branch for your changes (e.g., `feature/your-feature-name`)

For detailed information about the branch protection setup, see [Branch Protection Guide](.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION_GUIDE.md).
